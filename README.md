# :star: randgen.py, a high quality file :star:
can be expanded and tweaked to work for other projects where you need a ridiculous number of random strings!

## why this
i made this because i needed a way to get ~50k random strings separated by -- in the following format:
> [string1]--[string2]--[string3]

## here is how to use it
command line format:
> python3 randgen.py [filename to write to] [number of strings to generate]

example:
> python3 randgen.py 10_long_line_file.txt 10

> python3 randgen.py 5_million_long_line_file.txt 5000000
